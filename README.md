The "Visual-Auditory Substitution" project represents a pioneering endeavour aimed at optimizing the convergence of visual and auditory sensory experiences. In response to the increasing demand for seamless integration of these modalities, our project employs state-of-the-art technologies, including OpenCV for real-time video capture, Tesseract OCR for precise text extraction, and gTTS for natural audio output. The primary objective is to overcome existing challenges related to accuracy and real-time processing, laying the foundation for an enhanced sensory substitution experience.
